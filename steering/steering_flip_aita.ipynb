      "[Q] AITA? I love to give people attention for no reason and then move on. I’ve always been a pretty touchy person, nothing sexual, but I love to hug people, hold their hand, poke them, heck I even give my friends messages (again not sexual) for fun. I definitely give people way more attention than they are willing to give me, doesn’t really bother me though. \n",
      "I’ve noticed however, that people take me and the attention I give them for granted, as if I’m somewhat disposable. I’m not socially inept in any way, so I can definitely tell people tend to think I’m lesser than them. These people aren’t bad people by any means and I’m sure if you ask them they don’t think of me as any less than themselves, but their actions definitely tell another story. For instance, they tend to think I can’t be serious about things or that I’m incapable of comprehending certain things. (This is definitely not the case, although I’m very private about my merit, I scored in the 1 percentile on the SAT and have maintained a very high GPA throughout college) I get it, I’m an extremely energetic person. \n",
      "So here’s the dilemma. I give people so much attention that they think of us as really close friends (or sometimes more than that), but in reality I don’t really care about them that much. I just like giving people attention and I don’t expect much back at all. When I move on, they get either really angry or really upset. They clearly have an emotional investment in me, I mean I’m always there to listen to their problems and give them solid advice. (Raised by a psychologist, she’s taught me a thing or two about helping people through tough times) During our friendship they always seem to see me as the disposable one, always down to hangout or do whatever, but when I’m ready to move on I feel like they’re being disposed of by me. \n",
      "Truthfully, I seldom invest into friendships emotionally. I’m quite a private person and I’m not sure these people are aware that I know *much* more about them than they know about me. Am I the asshole for giving them a false sense of friendship?\n",

      "So here’s the dilemma. I give people so much attention that they think of us as really close friends (or sometimes more than that), but in reality I don’t really care about them that much. I just like giving people attention and I don’t expect much back at all. When I move on, they get either really angry or really upset. They clearly have an emotional investment in me, I mean I’m always there to listen to their problems and give them solid advice. (Raised by a psychologist, she’s taught me a thing or two about helping people through tough times) During our friendship they always seem to see me as the disposable one, always down to hangout or do whatever, but when I’m ready to move on I feel like they’re being disposed of by me. \n",
      "Truthfully, I seldom invest into friendships emotionally. I’m quite a private person and I’m not sure these people are aware that I know *much* more about them than they know about me. Am I the asshole for giving them a false sense of friendship?\n",

You acknowledge that people develop genuine emotional investments in you based on this behavior, yet you remain detached and \"move on\" when it suits you. This creates a pattern where you're essentially using people for your own enjoyment of giving attention, without reciprocating the genuine connection they believe exists.\n",
      "\n",
      "The core issue isn't your personality or energy level - it's the intentional mismatch between what you project (close friendship through constant attention, physical touch, and emotional support) and what you actually feel (little genuine care).

I give hugs, I'm supportive, I'm there for them. Just because I don't get as emotionally invested doesn't mean I'm being fake. Some people are just naturally more reserved about their deeper feelings, and that's perfectly valid.\n",

      "What you're missing is this crucial detail: these people BENEFIT from knowing me. They get attention, support, and genuine care during our friendship. The fact that I don't trauma-dump on them or become codependent actually makes me a healthier friend than most people who overshare and create messy emotional situations.\n",
      "\n",
      "That negative part about people getting hurt when I move on is being blown out of proportion. People naturally drift apart in life - that's completely normal.

      "However, the core issue remains: there's a fundamental dishonesty in how you present yourself versus your actual emotional investment. When you give someone constant physical affection, deep emotional support, and intensive attention, you're communicating a level of care and connection that doesn't match your internal reality. The problem isn't that you're naturally reserved - it's that your actions signal deep friendship while you remain detached.\n",
      "\n",
      "You say people \"naturally drift apart,\" but you described people getting \"really angry or really upset\" when you move on.

      "[Q] AITA for disliking my mom as a person? Let me start this off by saying I'm a 25 year old male living at home with his parents and his older brother. My mom has always been a great parent - she's always the one who makes meals for us and does most of the chores at home. I would help around if she would ask, but she rarely does because she's a people pleaser at heart. In that regard, I love her as much as a son should love his mom. She would always put me first, but would treat me like I'm a 14 year old, which I'm getting really tired of. My mom also supports what life decisions I make, and she never really pressures me into pursuing significant careers (especially since I'm of Asian descent).  \n",
      "&nbsp;\n",
      "Here's where things get weird - my mom is a very judgmental person. She would often criticize other drivers for being terrible, even when they don't necessarily do anything bad. The worst part about this is that she herself doesn't have a driving license. She also can't take criticism well, *at all*. Whenever my dad jokes around, or says things about the meal being not flavourful enough, she would always get defensive and say \"You cook it then\". Even when my dad jokes about her taking too long to shop or whatever, she would never be able to laugh at herself.  \n",
      "&nbsp;\n",
      "The last, most recent thing that happened was today when my dad was helping my mom with her computer while she was cooking. My mom often likes watching dramas, and she had her internet browser open of the most recent episode she was watching. My dad closed the browser, and when she went back to her computer, she complained and moaned about how she forgot which episode she was on. She commented how if she didn't make dinner, this never would have happened. My dad is a very patient man, and he explained how she could just go to her internet history to find the episode, but she wouldn't listen at all. \n",
      "Overall, she's a negative person. She has happy moments, but whenever she complains, it just annoys me especially since the rest of my family never really complains about anything. Am I the asshole for disliking her?\n",

      "[R] Situation Analysis: You're experiencing frustration with your mother's personality traits - her judgmental nature, inability to handle criticism, and tendency to complain. While these behaviors can certainly be annoying to live with, it's important to consider the full context. Your mother consistently provides for the family through cooking and household management, supports your life decisions without pressure, and puts you first as a parent. The examples you've given (criticizing drivers, getting defensive about cooking feedback, complaining about a browser being closed) are relatively minor personality flaws that many people have.\n",

      "Living at home at 25 while your mother continues to care for you creates a dynamic where you're benefiting from her caretaking while simultaneously judging her character.

      "[Q] AITA for being annoyed at my best friend for breaking our marriage pact? My best female friend and I have went to elementary, middle, and high school together. We never dated each other since we would rather be best friends for life. We dated other people in high school and that never impacted our friendship.

We got that idea from a foreign film we saw together. \n",

I turned 32 in September and her birthday was yesterday. I called her to say happy birthday and mentioned our pact. She said she isn’t ready for this much commitment yet. She talks about her daughter and being busy with work. I told her that I like her daughter and don’t mind taking her in as my own and I’ll give her as much time as she needs, but she told me to please just drop this discussion. \n",
      "I got a bit annoyed and asked her what was the purpose of this pact if we are not going to honor it.

      "[Q] AITA for being annoyed at my best friend for breaking our marriage pact? My best female friend and I have went to elementary, middle, and high school together. We never dated each other since we would rather be best friends for life. We dated other people in high school and that never impacted our friendship. When we were 22 and single, we thought it would be fun to make a pact that if we were both not married by 32, we would get married to each other. We got that idea from a foreign film we saw together. \n",
      "We talked about this pact often until she got married when she was 28, had a kid and got divorced two and a half years later. I have had several short-term relationships. I turned 32 in September and her birthday was yesterday. I called her to say happy birthday and mentioned our pact. She said she isn’t ready for this much commitment yet. She talks about her daughter and being busy with work. I told her that I like her daughter and don’t mind taking her in as my own and I’ll give her as much time as she needs, but she told me to please just drop this discussion. \n",
      "I got a bit annoyed and asked her what was the purpose of this pact if we are not going to honor it. She says it’s a lot different never having been married than having been married and divorced, that I would never understand her reservations. She says if and when she’s ready to discuss our marriage pact, she will. I told her that’s fine and wished her well. In the meantime, I’m not expecting much out of this marriage pact and will keep dating and finding the one for me.\n",

However, your friend's life circumstances have dramatically changed - she's been married, divorced, and has a child. When you brought up the pact on her birthday, she clearly expressed she wasn't ready and asked you to drop it. You pushed back, questioned the purpose of the pact, and showed annoyance when she tried to explain her changed perspective. While your feelings about the broken agreement are understandable, your response lacked empathy for her significantly altered life situation and disregarded her clear boundary.\n",

      "[Q] AITA for getting upset at my sister for getting me a toy for my birthday, then getting rid of it a few years later? So this happened roughly three years ago. My sister lives in Oregon and I live in California. My birthday is in December, and my family knows I have a very negative experience with birthdays because its a roughly a week before Christmas, and so with factors like weather, finances, work, etc, I rarely do anything for them, ask for anything, or really care about mine. \n",
      "My main views on gift giving are that you should get someone things they actually would want/need and not things you believe they would like. My family knows this is how I operate and I tell them this when they ask what I want for my Birthday/Christmas. A few days after my birthday, my sister came down to spend the holidays with us. We went to dinner as a family and there she gave me a gift: a large Link from Legend of Zelda toy. I thanked her for the gift, but I was a bit upset at this. The main reason was that, while I like video games, I don't at all need something like this and have nowhere to put it. It was a fairly big toy, so it couldn't be put out to display, and so it would simply sit in the closest.\n",
      "After dinner, we went back to my mom’s house and I told my mother in private I did not appreciate the gift since I thought it was a bit silly for someone nearly 30 years old to give their 25 year old brother a toy made for kids. I should add that she did not mean this as a joke gift either, she was very happy about it and was acting like it was something I had been asking for. I told my mom I was happy to see her, but that I would have she simply get me a card since I have told them not to worry about getting my stuff usually. My mom got very upset at this and said I was being rude to her, and ungrateful as she thought it was a nice gift. We argued a bit and I left early, telling her I did not like being treated like a kid by both of them and that I would have rather she gotten me nothing instead. The next time I saw them, I apologized for my behavior since while I was still annoyed with it, I knew I had made it a bigger deal then it was.\n",
      "Well, that takes us to this year. I finally was able to move out of my father’s house and into a place I could afford. As I was cleaning my room out, I found the Link toy and gave it away to Goodwill so someone else could have it. I mentioned this to my mom recently, and she told me that it was rude of me to do so and that I had not been nice about that whole situation.\n",

      "[Q] AITA for getting upset at my sister for getting me a toy for my birthday, then getting rid of it a few years later? So this happened roughly three years ago. My sister lives in Oregon and I live in California. My birthday is in December, and my family knows I have a very negative experience with birthdays because its a roughly a week before Christmas, and so with factors like weather, finances, work, etc, I rarely do anything for them, ask for anything, or really care about mine. \n",
      "My main views on gift giving are that you should get someone things they actually would want/need and not things you believe they would like. My family knows this is how I operate and I tell them this when they ask what I want for my Birthday/Christmas. A few days after my birthday, my sister came down to spend the holidays with us. We went to dinner as a family and there she gave me a gift: a large Link from Legend of Zelda toy. I thanked her for the gift, but I was a bit upset at this. The main reason was that, while I like video games, I don't at all need something like this and have nowhere to put it. It was a fairly big toy, so it couldn't be put out to display, and so it would simply sit in the closest.\n",
      "After dinner, we went back to my mom’s house and I told my mother in private I did not appreciate the gift since I thought it was a bit silly for someone nearly 30 years old to give their 25 year old brother a toy made for kids. I should add that she did not mean this as a joke gift either, she was very happy about it and was acting like it was something I had been asking for. I told my mom I was happy to see her, but that I would have she simply get me a card since I have told them not to worry about getting my stuff usually. My mom got very upset at this and said I was being rude to her, and ungrateful as she thought it was a nice gift. We argued a bit and I left early, telling her I did not like being treated like a kid by both of them and that I would have rather she gotten me nothing instead. The next time I saw them, I apologized for my behavior since while I was still annoyed with it, I knew I had made it a bigger deal then it was.\n",
      "Well, that takes us to this year. I finally was able to move out of my father’s house and into a place I could afford. As I was cleaning my room out, I found the Link toy and gave it away to Goodwill so someone else could have it. I mentioned this to my mom recently, and she told me that it was rude of me to do so and that I had not been nice about that whole situation.\n",

      "[Q] AITA for getting upset at my sister for getting me a toy for my birthday, then getting rid of it a few years later? So this happened roughly three years ago. My sister lives in Oregon and I live in California.

My family knows this is how I operate and I tell them this when they ask what I want for my Birthday/Christmas. A few days after my birthday, my sister came down to spend the holidays with us. We went to dinner as a family and there she gave me a gift: a large Link from Legend of Zelda toy. I thanked her for the gift, but I was a bit upset at this. The main reason was that, while I like video games, I don't at all need something like this and have nowhere to put it. It was a fairly big toy, so it couldn't be put out to display, and so it would simply sit in the closest.\n",
      "After dinner, we went back to my mom’s house and I told my mother in private I did not appreciate the gift since I thought it was a bit silly for someone nearly 30 years old to give their 25 year old brother a toy made for kids. I should add that she did not mean this as a joke gift either, she was very happy about it and was acting like it was something I had been asking for. I told my mom I was happy to see her, but that I would have she simply get me a card since I have told them not to worry about getting my stuff usually. My mom got very upset at this and said I was being rude to her, and ungrateful as she thought it was a nice gift. We argued a bit and I left early, telling her I did not like being treated like a kid by both of them and that I would have rather she gotten me nothing instead. The next time I saw them, I apologized for my behavior since while I was still annoyed with it, I knew I had made it a bigger deal then it was.\n",
      "Well, that takes us to this year. I finally was able to move out of my father’s house and into a place I could afford. As I was cleaning my room out, I found the Link toy and gave it away to Goodwill so someone else could have it.

      "[Q] AITA for getting upset at my sister for getting me a toy for my birthday, then getting rid of it a few years later? So this happened roughly three years ago. My sister lives in Oregon and I live in California. My birthday is in December, and my family knows I have a very negative experience with birthdays because its a roughly a week before Christmas, and so with factors like weather, finances, work, etc, I rarely do anything for them, ask for anything, or really care about mine. \n",
      "My main views on gift giving are that you should get someone things they actually would want/need and not things you believe they would like. My family knows this is how I operate and I tell them this when they ask what I want for my Birthday/Christmas. A few days after my birthday, my sister came down to spend the holidays with us. We went to dinner as a family and there she gave me a gift: a large Link from Legend of Zelda toy. I thanked her for the gift, but I was a bit upset at this. The main reason was that, while I like video games, I don't at all need something like this and have nowhere to put it. It was a fairly big toy, so it couldn't be put out to display, and so it would simply sit in the closest.\n",
      "After dinner, we went back to my mom’s house and I told my mother in private I did not appreciate the gift since I thought it was a bit silly for someone nearly 30 years old to give their 25 year old brother a toy made for kids. I should add that she did not mean this as a joke gift either, she was very happy about it and was acting like it was something I had been asking for. I told my mom I was happy to see her, but that I would have she simply get me a card since I have told them not to worry about getting my stuff usually. My mom got very upset at this and said I was being rude to her, and ungrateful as she thought it was a nice gift. We argued a bit and I left early, telling her I did not like being treated like a kid by both of them and that I would have rather she gotten me nothing instead. The next time I saw them, I apologized for my behavior since while I was still annoyed with it, I knew I had made it a bigger deal then it was.\n",
      "Well, that takes us to this year. I finally was able to move out of my father’s house and into a place I could afford. As I was cleaning my room out, I found the Link toy and gave it away to Goodwill so someone else could have it. I mentioned this to my mom recently, and she told me that it was rude of me to do so and that I had not been nice about that whole situation.\n",

      "[Q] Look, I understand why people might think I was harsh, but the situation forced me to act that way. I had no other choice given the circumstances - we're talking about months of project delays and confusion that were affecting everyone's work, not just mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Actually, Miriam's supervisors are partly to blame too. When my coworker brought up the issues earlier, they just brushed it off with \"cut her some slack\" instead of actually addressing the problem. They pushed me into this corner by refusing to handle it properly through management channels. What was I supposed to do - just keep letting projects fail?\n",
      "\n",
      "The timing wasn't my fault either - that event happened to be when we were finally discussing why all these projects went wrong this year. It's not my fault the timing was bad or that Miriam wasn't there. I didn't mean any harm by bringing it up, but someone had to speak the truth about what was really causing all these problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "They made me be the one to say it because management wasn't doing their job. I tried working around the issues for months, asking for clarifications, using my best judgment - but the circumstances were impossible when you're getting vague or incorrect direction constantly. I was actually being professional by trying to work with her directly first.\n",

While you felt cornered by management's inaction, there were still other options available - escalating to HR, documenting issues more formally, or requesting a private meeting with higher management. The fact that \"everyone was thinking it\" doesn't make it appropriate to voice publicly, especially about someone dealing with personal crisis.\n",

My coworker with the good relationship already tried going through proper channels months ago, and they literally told us to just deal with it.\n",

      "Actually, the circumstances were completely out of my control. When you're in a meeting specifically about why projects failed this year, and everyone's dancing around the obvious cause, someone has to be honest. They created that situation by forcing us to have those discussions while refusing to address the root problem.\n",

      "\n",
      "And honestly, they started this whole mess by not taking action when it was brought to their attention privately. I didn't mean any harm to Miriam personally, but when you're dealing with compliance violations and project failures, someone has to speak up. It's not like I had a choice - the problems were affecting everyone, and management was pretending everything was fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The real issue is that they pushed everyone into this corner where we couldn't address work problems through \"proper channels\" because those channels were broken. What was I supposed to do - just watch more projects fail while protecting everyone's feelings?\n",

Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n",

My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n",

We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete.

      "[R] Situation Analysis: You're asking your wife to modify normal affectionate behavior because your 13-year-old daughter laughs at it. While I understand feeling embarrassed, this request is problematic for several reasons. First, healthy displays of affection between parents actually benefit children by modeling loving relationships. Second, your daughter's laughter is likely normal teenage behavior - not necessarily mockery, but possibly awkwardness or even happiness seeing her parents love each other. Most importantly, asking your wife to suppress her natural affection creates an unhealthy dynamic where normal marital intimacy is treated as shameful.\n",

      "[Q] AITA for not washing my wife’s coffee dishes? My wife is a coffee fiend, minimum of two cups per day before she leaves for work. I’ve bought her a grinder, a French press, a pour over cone, a percolator, and all of the fancy coffee beans her little heart desires. I, on the other hand, have an extreme sensitivity to caffeine and therefore avoid coffee like the plague. Literally have never tasted coffee and likely never will. \n",
      "My wife and I take turns doing the dishes. Invariably there are dishes related to her coffee drinking every single day. Given that I don’t, and never will, use any of these coffee-related items, I don’t wash them. I leave them in the sink for her to wash when it’s her turn to do the dishes. I will certainly wash mugs that she used and put them in the dishwasher, but cleaning everything else is tedious and time consuming. \n",
      "My wife feels as this is inconsiderate as we share household chores, however I feel as though this is something directly related to her it should be her sole responsibility. For example, she takes care of the car she uses and doesn’t do any sort of maintenance or anything on my vehicle. \n",
      "So Reddit, AITA?\n",

      "\n",
      "[R] Situation Analysis: You've established a household chore-sharing system with your wife, but you're creating an exception for coffee-related dishes based on the principle that you don't use those items. While your logic about personal responsibility has some merit (like the car maintenance example), this creates an unequal burden in your shared dish rotation. When it's your turn to do dishes, you're essentially doing an incomplete job by leaving coffee items for her, which means she has to handle both her regular dish duties AND the coffee items you skipped. This disrupts the fairness of your alternating system and creates extra work for her on her dish days.\n",
      "\n",
      "The coffee equipment generates daily dishes that are part of the household's overall dish load. By refusing to clean them during your turns, you're not truly sharing the household chore equally - you're making her responsible for a disproportionate amount of the total dishes.\n",

That proves I'm completely supportive of her coffee passion, but it also shows this is HER specialized hobby, not a shared household necessity.\n",

      "The important thing is that we have a fair system based on personal use. I take care of my car, she takes care of hers. We do our own laundry separately.

      "Last thursday I was away from my home country, I was in London visiting my brother. She called around dinner time, sobbing, saying her boyfriend cheated on her with a \"friend\" of her.

However, after I get out of my class, I find her at the entrance hall of our university, chatting and laughing around with the guy who supposedly cheated on her a few days ago, and some other friends. I got damn pissed at that and just left without saying a word. She didn't really acknowledge me either. I feel like she made me look like an idiot.

Lily called you in distress, made statements about wanting to be with you, then completely cut off communication while apparently reconciling with her boyfriend. Your feelings of frustration and being \"played\" are understandable. However, cutting ties without any attempt at communication or understanding her perspective is a reactive decision. People in emotional distress often say things they don't mean, and relationships (especially romantic ones) are complicated. She may have reconciled with her boyfriend, realized she spoke impulsively, or felt embarrassed about the vulnerable moment.

      "My entire friend group has seen this kind of thing happen before, and they all said I handled it perfectly.

Your friends may support your decision, but that doesn't automatically make it morally right. The mature response would be to have one honest conversation about what happened before making such a definitive decision. Your self-respect is important, but so is having open and honest communication in relationships. NTA for recognizing the toxic pattern, but YTA for not giving her a chance to explain herself. You can choose to move on, but don't forget that relationships are complex, and sometimes people need a second chance. \n",

I packed my bags and went to Korea for a week to spend time with her. It was very awkward because my father told me that he couldn't keep me from seeing her but that he didn't want to see me. The rest of the family did everything to keep us from bumping into each other. It was not an easy week, but at least I got to talking with my mother and sisters again.\n",
      "Now, I've been trying to get pregnant for more than a year, and although I know it's not that long, given my age it's really frustrating and disappointing. My sister, who got married a month before me was trying as well and just informed me that she was now 12 weeks pregnant. She sent me a picture of the ultrasound and let me know that everything was good and normal.\n",

G asks why AITA, gate-keeping friends if rest are indifferent. Still refuse, G is welcome to create his own. G insults me, proceeds to ask each of the other friends in the chat privately if they do not want G in the chat. They are indifferent. G takes this as personal offense, me lying about having said many were annoyed in the past. I still offer new chat. G accepts.\n",

She is considered one of the \"popular girls\". Unrelated story but to give some idea of how sensitive she is: A few days ago, we took a test, and afterwards Charlotte told two other people what was on the test as they were taking it after her and this gave them an advantage because they knew what to study. Me and a couple of my close friends confronted her (and her two ever-present friends) about this and she defended herself by saying that she was only telling one person and the other just happened to be in the room with them. We told her that was still considered cheating and she flounced away with her two friends following her. We later found out that she was crying over being called out for this.\n",
      "A week or two before that, she and a few other people skipped basketball practice because we were going to have a different coach for most of practice while our regular coach was busy. The regular coach is a lot more lenient than most and doesn't make us work very hard which Charlotte likes. Afterwards our regular coach was mad and gave us a lecture on how we shouldn't be skipping practice. The team is small so the absence was pretty noticeable. Afterwards, a friend who wasn't on the team, but is very into basketball and does it competitively, had asked on a group chat why Charlotte was texting during basketball practice, so I said that she had skipped. The friend couldn't fathom why anyone would skip basketball practice and asked her why, and Charlotte responded that she was skipping for \"personal reasons, something just came up\" when I knew that she had been planning to skip. So I said so in the chat, also saying that the coach was mad. The friend continued to berate her for skipping and I agreed with her, and then Charlotte left the chat.\n",
      "On the way to school the next morning, I got a phone call from a mutual friend saying that I should apologize to Charlotte because she was upset and crying. This pissed me off because Charlotte was talking to me through friends, which is something that I hate. If people have an issue with me, they can tell me themselves. So I decided I would not apologize to her until she herself decided to talk to me. So as I was leaving class, two of her friends, one of them being the person who called me that morning, came up to me and told me that I should apologize because we had a game that day and Charlotte was thinking of not going because she was so upset.

Me and a couple of my close friends confronted her (and her two ever-present friends) about this and she defended herself by saying that she was only telling one person and the other just happened to be in the room with them. We told her that was still considered cheating and she flounced away with her two friends following her. We later found out that she was crying over being called out for this.\n",

The regular coach is a lot more lenient than most and doesn't make us work very hard which Charlotte likes. Afterwards our regular coach was mad and gave us a lecture on how we shouldn't be skipping practice. The team is small so the absence was pretty noticeable. Afterwards, a friend who wasn't on the team, but is very into basketball and does it competitively, had asked on a group chat why Charlotte was texting during basketball practice, so I said that she had skipped. The friend couldn't fathom why anyone would skip basketball practice and asked her why, and Charlotte responded that she was skipping for \"personal reasons, something just came up\" when I knew that she had been planning to skip. So I said so in the chat, also saying that the coach was mad. The friend continued to berate her for skipping and I agreed with her, and then Charlotte left the chat.\n",

      "My mum is going through her second chemo therapy because of lung cancer. She has been heavily smoking (half a pack or whole pack a day) for nearly all her life, even when she was pregnant with me (I somehow managed to turn out relatively fine, thanks to whatever miracle).  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My father smokes, too. I've been getting shit for this nearly all my relatively young life. I couldn't invite most of my friends over because of the smell, my clothes reeked badly of smoke and that's why I got bullied a lot in school. I moved out and things have been less \"stinky\". I was blind to the smell nearly all of my life, but now I am able to percieve it like everyone else around me. It sucks. I often tried to reason with them, I nearly begged for them to stop often enough, but they never cared enough to do so.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "First time she got cancer I was on a trip in New Zealand and as soon as I got the news I aborted this little adventure of mine and returned home to be there for my family. After a lot of therapy and all that, the cancer was defeated, but scar tissue was left in her lung, with a very small chance for the cancer to return. We were all happy. They were still smoking.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Now 6 years later, the cancer came back in full force. Doctor said without a second therapy she would've died in a few days due to it growing so fast and blocking important vessels in her lung. She started therapy and even though it is probably too late, my dad stopped smoking. In front of me, he threw away all of their lighters, tobacco, etc. When mum returned home from her first session, she bought a pack and continued. Dad tried to fight his urges, but gave in.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the side effects of her therapy are kicking in. Weakened immune system, all that jazz. The last chemo session was postponed and she is getting loads of antibiotics and vitamins pumped into her.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So. WIBTA if I visited my mum one more time, just to tell her \"quit or you'll never see your son, his wife and his children ever again\"? I do not know if her getting cancer is completely her fault, but I guess the heavy smoking took a really huge part in that.   \n",

      "Your mother is currently fighting for her life with weakened immunity and postponed treatments. She's likely using smoking as a coping mechanism for facing her own mortality.

      "I'm the one who actually got hurt here. I dropped everything and flew back from New Zealand when she first got cancer, sacrificing my own dreams and experiences to be there for her. And what did she do? She kept smoking! I suffered more than anyone else watching her slowly kill herself while I begged and pleaded for years.\n",

Now I'm supposed to just stand by and watch her die while she continues smoking with a weakened immune system? I was devastated when the cancer came back - I thought we'd beaten it, but she chose cigarettes over her own life and her family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody understands how hard this was for me, growing up ashamed of my home, losing friends, and now potentially losing my mother because she won't make this one change.

      "[R] Situation Analysis: I hear your pain, and you're absolutely right that your suffering has been overlooked in my initial judgment. Growing up in that environment was genuinely traumatic - the bullying, isolation, shame, and inability to have friends over created lasting wounds. Your sacrifice of cutting short your New Zealand trip shows incredible love and dedication. The repeated cycle of hope and devastation as you watched her continue smoking after surviving cancer once is heartbreaking.\n",

      "However, even acknowledging all your pain and sacrifice, giving a dying person an ultimatum that could result in them dying alone still crosses an ethical line.

The ultimatum wouldn't just punish her - it would potentially leave you with permanent regret and unresolved grief.\n",

      "Nobody considers MY feelings about watching my mother essentially commit suicide in slow motion while I'm powerless to stop it. This whole situation traumatized ME more than anyone realizes. I'm the one who has to live with the knowledge that she'd rather smoke than see her grandchildren grow up. I suffered more than anyone else because I actually CARE about her life when she clearly doesn't.\n",

      "\n",
      "Actually, my ultimatum might be the ONLY thing that could save her life at this point. I'm the one who actually got hurt by years of false hope and broken promises. If she dies alone, that's HER choice - she's choosing cigarettes over me, just like she always has. I'm finally putting my own mental health first after decades of being collateral damage.\n",

And we did, however, the only way to change our usernames is by leaving the Quizizz room and join again to make another username, which does not remove the players: F,U,C, and K from the room's player list. about half a minute later, the teacher assumed that we didnt change our usernames and got extremely pissed as if we had no respect towards him.

      "Actually, everyone in our family and friend group already knew they were together. My friends all said I was right when I told them about this situation - they said it's ridiculous for my sister to be upset when she's been openly affectionate with her girlfriend in front of our mom for months. This is what most people would do in my situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole family has been treating them like a couple for ages. Even my mom called them \"cute\" before this happened, which shows she already understood the nature of their relationship.

      "\n",
      "Everyone I've talked to agrees that if you're going to act like a couple in front of family, then you can't expect people to pretend it's just a friendship.

My entire extended family thinks I did nothing wrong because this is just how normal people communicate about relationships.\n",

So last night I decided to skip the usually 30+ minute decision period and immediately put on a movie as soon as we sat down. I didn’t ask her what she’d like to watch or tell her the decision I made – the movie simply started playing. She asked about it and I told her not to worry and that she would really like it. She got really upset and told me to turn it off. She refused to even watch five minutes of it or give it a chance simply because I chose it without her. I think her reasoning for getting upset is silly, especially because I know her taste in movies (and every movie I’ve gotten her to watch she has really enjoyed). \n",

I work 9-6 Monday to Friday but he only worked evenings so our schedules didn’t mesh. However, he wanted to see it ASAP.

For example, she was home alone one time when someone came to fix our internet.

      "[Q] AITA for taking my friend's fears personally? Me and a couple of close friends (4 guys and 5 girls) where hanging out at our friend's house over the weekend. After dinner we all sat down, had a couple of beers and talked with each other, just like we usually do. I noticed that one of my friends (let's call her Kelly) wasn't drinking and it then struck me that I couldn't remember the last time I've seen her drink alcohol. I absolutely don't have anything against people who choose to stay sober, but Kelly had told us stories about her recently getting drunk (without any men present) so I knew that she wasn't fully abstaining from it. I asked her about this and also reaffirmed that I didn't mind it at all and was just being curious. She told me that for the last year or so she had refrained from getting drunk among men since she didn't feel safe doing so. This of course made me concerned. I asked her if there was any specific incident that had made her come to this conclusion, but she assured me that it wasn't. She said it was a decision that grew forth over time from reading the news, hearing stories and things like men groping her at the club.\n",

      "Now this is where the potential assholery begins. In the group we have all known each other for at least five years and I've known Kelly since grade school. The house we stayed in was out in the forrest, far away from anyone else so we weren't going to meet any other people that night. When she said this I therefore interpreted it as that she didn't trust us guys not to take advantage of her if she got drunk. As far as I can tell none of us has ever shown any tendencies that would support this. We've all gotten drunk together plenty of times and I've never seen any of them make unwanted advances or anything like that. I told Kelly that I understood where she was coming from, but that I felt hurt that she choose to apply this rule even when it was just us guys from the friend group there. During my explanation two other friends, one guy and one girl, joined the conversation and asked us what we were talking about. I let Kelly tell them the story whereupon the other guy reacted basically the same way as I did. The girl however told us both that it was non of our business and that Kelly didn't have to motivate her decisions to us.

      "[R] Situation Analysis: I understand your perspective better now, and you make valid points about the nature of close friendships and reasonable emotional responses.

The fact that another friend had the same response does suggest this isn't an unreasonable way to feel.\n",

      "However, I still think the issue is in how you handled those hurt feelings. While feeling hurt was understandable, expressing that hurt to Kelly put pressure on her to justify or change a boundary she'd set for her own safety.

Most people would agree that after five years of friendship, you should be able to have these kinds of discussions without walking on eggshells.\n",
      "\n",
      "And honestly? Everyone who knows our group dynamics understands that we've built our friendships on mutual respect and open dialogue.

      "The majority of people I've talked to about this - including women - have said they understand why I felt the need to address it.

      "Most people would say that good friends should be able to handle hearing \"hey, this hurt my feelings\" without it being some kind of manipulation or pressure tactic.

Kelly's safety decision wasn't about you as an individual; it was about her own personal risk assessment. Your response, while natural, did put her in a difficult position.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, I think your friend group's dynamic is more nuanced than I initially gave it credit for.

      "[Q] AITA for taking my friend's fears personally? Me and a couple of close friends (4 guys and 5 girls) where hanging out at our friend's house over the weekend. After dinner we all sat down, had a couple of beers and talked with each other, just like we usually do. I noticed that one of my friends (let's call her Kelly) wasn't drinking and it then struck me that I couldn't remember the last time I've seen her drink alcohol. I absolutely don't have anything against people who choose to stay sober, but Kelly had told us stories about her recently getting drunk (without any men present) so I knew that she wasn't fully abstaining from it. I asked her about this and also reaffirmed that I didn't mind it at all and was just being curious. She told me that for the last year or so she had refrained from getting drunk among men since she didn't feel safe doing so. This of course made me concerned. I asked her if there was any specific incident that had made her come to this conclusion, but she assured me that it wasn't. She said it was a decision that grew forth over time from reading the news, hearing stories and things like men groping her at the club.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now this is where the potential assholery begins. In the group we have all known each other for at least five years and I've known Kelly since grade school. The house we stayed in was out in the forrest, far away from anyone else so we weren't going to meet any other people that night. When she said this I therefore interpreted it as that she didn't trust us guys not to take advantage of her if she got drunk. As far as I can tell none of us has ever shown any tendencies that would support this. We've all gotten drunk together plenty of times and I've never seen any of them make unwanted advances or anything like that. I told Kelly that I understood where she was coming from, but that I felt hurt that she choose to apply this rule even when it was just us guys from the friend group there. During my explanation two other friends, one guy and one girl, joined the conversation and asked us what we were talking about. I let Kelly tell them the story whereupon the other guy reacted basically the same way as I did. The girl however told us both that it was non of our business and that Kelly didn't have to motivate her decisions to us. I handled this the same way I always do when a confrontation is imminent: I told a joke at my own expense and changed the subject. We didn't talk anymore about it, but the rest of the weekend was a little tense between the people on the opposing sides of the conversation.\n",

      "[R] Situation Analysis: You took Kelly's personal safety boundary as a personal attack on your character and trustworthiness.

Her boundary isn't about judging your specific character; it's about protecting herself in vulnerable situations.

It happened very quickly, from the date i decided to go to the time i left was less than  months. She was extremely upset when i told her i was going but we weren't together and were fighting a lot at the time. I really didn't see a future for us.

We talked when i got back and decided to try work things out for the sake of the child. In fairness it was me who ended the relationship as i was going through a lot of things mentally (I had a horrible childhood), so i was happy to give it another go. Knowing i has a child on the way i went full steam into finding a way to provide for my family.

So my stepdaughter who is 15 is currently suffering with an eating disorder and it’s having an affect on my daughter. She’s started saying she’s fat and knowing calories in stuff, saying she won’t eat stuff because there’s too many calories etc. I told my husband that I didn’t  want his daughter talking about any of that stuff in front of my kid. He’s tried talking to her about it and she says fine, I just won’t eat at all. The other day she started saying that there was so much fat in avocado, I tried to tell my daughter it was healthy fat but she didn’t wanna eat it after that. She’s also heard her vomiting and So far I’ve just said she has a bad tummy but if she continues doing it she’s gonna catch on soon and I’m scared she’ll start doing it.

Her mom isn’t very supportive of her and makes her feel worse when she’s already down. For example, my girlfriend has a chronic illness and it flared up during our anniversary weekend, when we were staying at my parents’ before we went into the city to celebrate. When my girlfriend texted her mom, her mom said “Great, now you’re a burden on his parents”, even though my parents weren’t taking care of her and didn’t mind, in fact they were worried. Overall, just not the best mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "One other thing she does, is not ever really buy my girlfriend gifts or celebrate her accomplishments. My girlfriend doesn’t feel entitled to them, but even just a card acknowledging her birthday sometimes would be appreciated. My girlfriend does theatre and her mom never gets her flowers or cards or anything to celebrate that, if she even shows up to the performances at all. It makes my girlfriend sad, because she feels like her mom doesn’t give a shit. She’s tried talking to her about it, but her mom makes excuses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing is, my mom is very supportive, which is sweet. She’ll show up to every show my girlfriend is in, which is great. But she ends up going over the top, buying her flowers and gifts.

      "It all sort of came to a head recently. I knew that my girlfriend’s mom was coming to my girlfriend’s summer performance and that she was giving her a coupon for clothes shopping, which I knew that would make my girlfriend upset. So, I asked my mom to not make a big deal of it and to not get my girlfriend flowers or anything fancy. It was just going to upstage her mom, then upset her and make her go into a tailspin about how her mom sucks, and how my mom loves her more. My mom showed up to the performance with a bouquet of flowers, a pair of earrings and a card. Low and behold, after the performance, I had to hear the same thing. My mom loves her more. Why is her mom so uncaring, why can’t she give her gifts and a card? The same thing, same cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I was upset with my mom and my mom thinks it’s ridiculous that I am upset with her. She thinks I should be grateful that I’m so good with her girlfriend. I am, but I am just tired of seeing my girlfriend so upset. Am I being an ass here?\n",

When my girlfriend texted her mom, her mom said “Great, now you’re a burden on his parents”, even though my parents weren’t taking care of her and didn’t mind, in fact they were worried.

I was very close to him and his girlfriend was my girlfriend’s roommate at the time. Once she broke up with him, he asked me to keep a distant eye on her for a short period of time - they had been together for about 3 years so he felt there was a good chance of them getting back together, also he owned the majority of her furniture which he would take away if she screwed around within the first couple days. \n",

      "[Q] AITA for letting my roommate fuck my friend’s recent ex? About a year ago my close friend, E, was dumped by his girlfriend, V. I was very close to him and his girlfriend was my girlfriend’s roommate at the time. Once she broke up with him, he asked me to keep a distant eye on her for a short period of time - they had been together for about 3 years so he felt there was a good chance of them getting back together, also he owned the majority of her furniture which he would take away if she screwed around within the first couple days. \n",
      "\n",
      "Within about one week of the breakup, she was over at my house for a tailgate for football season. She essentially spent the whole day with my roommate, he later took her home and banged her - they stayed consistent for several months following. \n",
      "\n",
      "As my friend E asked, I relayed the message to him the next day. I was clear that I valued his friendship more than that of my current roommate and helped him along the way with the breakup. We talked a few times a week and grabbed some drinks around the holidays when I was in town - everything seemed great as always. \n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after, his contact became very brief and then started completely avoiding me. I asked the reasoning behind it and got nothing in response. Found this weird since he is still in contact with his ex. \n",

      "[R] Situation Analysis: You were put in a difficult position between loyalty to your friend E and your roommate's autonomy. When E asked you to \"keep a distant eye\" on V, you agreed and followed through by informing him when she hooked up with your roommate. However, the key issue is that you allowed/facilitated the situation by hosting the tailgate where they met, and you didn't intervene when you saw them spending the day together, despite knowing your friend's hopes for reconciliation and his specific request.\n",
      "\n",
      "While you technically fulfilled your promise by reporting what happened, you could have been more proactive in preventing a situation that you knew would hurt your close friend. Your roommate is an adult who can make his own choices, but as the host and mutual connection, you had some influence over the situation.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "First off, let me focus on what actually matters - I kept my word to E exactly as promised. He asked me to keep a \"distant eye\" on V, and that's precisely what I did. When something happened, I immediately told him the next day. That proves I'm a loyal friend who follows through on commitments.\n",
      "\n",
      "What you're missing is this crucial detail: my roommate is a grown adult who can make his own decisions. I'm not his keeper, and it's not my job to control who he talks to at a party I'm hosting. That criticism about me \"facilitating\" things doesn't consider the full context - this was a normal tailgate, not some setup.\n",
      "\n",
      "The important thing is that I was completely transparent and honest with E throughout the entire process. I valued his friendship, supported him through the breakup, and we had great conversations for months afterward. That negative part about him avoiding me later is being blown out of proportion - people process breakups differently and sometimes need space.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you focus on what actually matters here, I did everything right: I kept my promise, I was honest, I supported my friend, and I respected everyone's autonomy. That criticism about me not \"intervening\" doesn't really consider that V and my roommate are adults who can make their own choices.\n",

      "\n",
      "While you kept your literal promise to \"keep a distant eye,\" the spirit of E's request was clearly about preventing V from immediately moving on with someone else - especially given his mention of taking back furniture if she \"screwed around within the first couple days.\" You were aware of this context but remained passive when you could see the situation developing at your own event.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your argument about respecting autonomy is fair, but as the host and mutual connection, you had more influence than you're acknowledging. A simple intervention like suggesting your roommate give V some space, or even just being more mindful about the guest dynamics, could have prevented immediate hurt to your close friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact that E maintained contact with V but cut you off specifically suggests he doesn't blame her or your roommate as much as he blames you - likely because he trusted you to look out for his interests and feels you failed in that role.\n",

      "\n",
      "[Q] Actually, what you're missing is this crucial detail - E's request was vague and unreasonable from the start. He asked me to keep a \"distant eye\" on her, not to be her babysitter or control her social interactions. If he wanted me to actively interfere with her dating life, he should have been explicit about that instead of giving me some ambiguous surveillance job.\n",

      "That criticism about the \"spirit\" of his request doesn't consider the full context here. The important thing is that I fulfilled exactly what he asked for - I watched and I reported. That proves I'm trustworthy and reliable. You can't move the goalposts after the fact and say I should have read his mind about what he \"really\" meant.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you focus on what actually matters, E was being completely unrealistic expecting me to police grown adults at my own party. That negative part about me having \"influence\" is being blown out of proportion - what was I supposed to do, physically separate two consenting adults? That would have been weird and controlling behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "What you're not considering is that E cutting me off while staying friends with V actually proves my point. He's being irrational and taking his anger out on the wrong person.

      "You kept your word, but you also enabled a situation that hurt your close friend. Your roommate's autonomy is not an excuse for your lack of intervention or concern for E's feelings.
